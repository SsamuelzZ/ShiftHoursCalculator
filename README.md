# Shift Hours Calculator
This program will help shift workers calculate how many hours they have worked, as well as how much they should be getting paid. To run the program, open the .sln file and hit **RUN** at the top. It will start by asking you how much you get paid hourly. Enter this amount and hit _ENTER_. Then, it will prompt you to put down the hours and minutes you have worked in each shift (your hours and minutes will be asked separately, please do not put both hours and minutes into 1 prompt). Once you have entered all the desired shifts, type out **END** when you get to the next **Hours** prompt. This will then list you your total hours, minutes and your pay total.
### Disclaimer!! Please Read:
Please note that I am fairly new to programming and C#, so there might be some errors or bugs hanging about. Please do not use this as a final confirmation of hours, and fact check this in case you want to prove any under-payment within your payroll. This is purely to get an idea of how much you will be getting paid, and as a practise for me with programming and mathematics. So far, I have not encountered any errors with the final outcomes, but do not take my word for it!
